    					<h3>Kobe Bryant</h3>
    					<p>
    						Kobe Bryant is currently the shooting guard of the Los Angeles Lakers. He has played in the NBA for 19 years all in the same team-Los Angeles Lakers. You might be wondering why did I put Kobe in the old star list? This is because Kobe’s aging has made him not as fit then when he first started playing, and that was a decade ago. During Kobe’s second season, he was voted a starter for a all-star game, becoming the youngest all-star of 19 years old in NBA history. He then teamed up with Shaquille O’Neil and won three consecutive champions for the lakers. Kobe has won 5 championships in total. One of Kobe’s most memorable moment is when he scored 81 points in a game, ranking the second highest points in a game. Although Kobe is retiring after the 2015-2016 season, he has left many memorable moments to us.
